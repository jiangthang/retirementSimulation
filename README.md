ST474 Monte Carlo Term Project 

Simulating Average Canadian finances for Retirement &amp; comparing to FIRE methods

Monte Carlo Simulations were ran to simulate potential paths to retirements
Simulated Variables:
  - Annual returns from stock market (data from S&P500 since inception)
  - Death age per individual (data from Statistics Canada average death age per age group over 3 years)

If you are interested in the code for the Monte Carlo Simulations, it is written in the Matlab. One file is for Conventional method and other is for FIRE method.
If you want to learn more about FIRE, see [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-independence-retire-early-fire.asp)

If you are interested in the Statistical Analysis and how to derived the math functions to simulate the variables like annual returns and death age, you can read the pdf report in the repo
